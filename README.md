# HR-Analytics-with-Logistic-Regression
This project explores logistic regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. The notebook guides users through the following key components:

Data Preprocessing: Importing and preparing datasets using libraries like pandas and numpy.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilizing seaborn and matplotlib for visualizing relationships in the data.

Model Development: Building logistic regression models using sklearn's linear_model.

Model Evaluation: Applying train-test splitting, accuracy scoring, and potentially other performance metrics.
